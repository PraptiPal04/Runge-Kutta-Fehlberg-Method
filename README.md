# Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg-Method
Solving the opinion dynamics system of non-linear differential equations for some simple networks using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method with adaptive step size control.
The main advantage is the faster convergence of this method compared to the Runge-Kutta 4 method, which has the same order of accuracy.
The opinion dynamics equations were solved for Path, Circle, Wheel and Star topologies. 
Interesting : The video Path_Topology_Disagreement.
The implementation of this method to solve the ode has been successful.
